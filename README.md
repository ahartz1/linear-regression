# Signs of Regression

## Description

Practice using linear regression through exercises.

## Objectives

* Use scikit-learn to perform linear regression
* Understand single-variable and multiple-variable linear regression

## Normal Mode

Go through the `simple-linear-regression.ipynb` file included with this repository and add cells to address the prompts, exploring the data through the use of pandas and scikit-learn.

Your final submission should be a well-organized IPython notebook file with charts and data exploring linear relationships in the data.

<!-- ## Hard Mode

Find another source of data that you suspect may have a single- or multiple-linear relationship, attempt to find a best fit model for the data, and report your findings, showing chart(s) as necessary -->

## To View This Notebook
Just click on the `simple-linear-regression.ipynb` file above.

## To Run This Notebook
### System Requirements / Installation

* You will need to have **python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine. See [python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* Clone this repo onto your machine.

* You will need to make sure that you have a virtual environment running in the folder that you intend to work from. [See this site for details if you're not familiar.](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) **Complete this step before attempting the below.**

* In your command-line program (such as Terminal on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X), navigate into the newly created repo. By default, this will be called `linear-regression`. Install the requirements file by runnning **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**.

### Opening the Notebook
* Using a command-line program, navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file and run the following line: **`ipython notebook simple-linear-regression.ipynb`**

* **Note:** This will open in a browser window and take over the command-line program's window until you close out of IPython Notebook. If you have closed your browser window, but your command line is still running the notebook, kill the process by pressing `Ctrl+C` or quitting the program entirely.
